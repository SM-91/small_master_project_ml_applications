# small_master_project_ml_applications
Worked on supervised learning using different ML techniques.

In this project I applied different Machine Learning techniques on the given dataset.
Originally my problem was to analyse between financial crisis and political stability among different countries. It was a supervised learning problem as the data was already given.
